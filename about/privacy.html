<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

<p>
Websites and software written by The Pffy Authors (collectively “pffy-cloud" in this document) refer to sites hosted on the pffy.dev, related domains and subdomains thereof, and other platforms.
</p>

<p>
This privacy policy describes how pffy-cloud uses and protects any information that you give us. We are committed to ensuring that your privacy is protected.
</p>

<p>
If you provide us with personal information through pffy-cloud, you can be assured that it will only be used in accordance with this privacy statement. However, in the vast majority of cases, pffy-cloud does not collect or store personal information.
</p>



<h2>Website Visitors</h2>

<p>
Like most website operators, pffy-cloud collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request.
</p>

<p>
pffy-cloud’s purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how pffy-cloud’s visitors use its website.
</p>

<p>
From time to time, pffy-cloud may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.
</p>

<p>
pffy-cloud also may collect potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. However, this information is quickly deleted or anonomized to reduce the cost of long-term retention.
</p>

<p>
pffy-cloud does not use IP addresses to identify its visitors, however, and does not disclose such information, other than under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information, as described below.
</p>



<h2>Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information</h2>

<p>
We do no gather personally-identifying information.
</p>


<h2>Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information</h2>

<p>
We do no gather personally-identifying information.
</p>



<h2>Use of personal information</h2>

<p>We do not gather personal information.</p>


<h2>Third Party Links</h2>

<p>
Our website may contain links to other websites provided by third parties not under our control. When following a link and providing information to a third-party website, please be aware that we are not responsible for the data provided to that third party.
</p>

<p>This privacy policy only applies to the websites listed at the beginning of this document, so when you visit other websites, even when you click on a link posted on pffy-cloud, you should read their own privacy policies.</p>

<h2>Aggregated Statistics</h2>

<p>
 pffy-cloud may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its websites. For instance, pffy-cloud may reveal how many times a particular version of software was downloaded or report on which plugins are the most popular, based on data gathered by pffy-cloud Web APIs, a web service used by pffy-cloud software installations to check for new versions of pffy-cloud software and Web APIs.
</p>

<p>
However, pffy-cloud does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described in this policy.
</p>

<h2>Cookies</h2>

<p>
  Additionally, information about how you use our website is collected automatically using “cookies”.
</p>

<p>
Cookies are text files placed on your computer to collect standard internet log information and visitor behaviour information. This information is used to track visitor use of the website and to compile statistical reports on website activity.</p>
</p>
  
<p>
Cookies are also used to build more personalized experiences without collecting personally-identifying information (e.g., preferred website color themes or text sizes).
</p>

<h2>Privacy Policy Changes</h2>

<p>
Although most changes are likely to be minor, pffy-cloud may change its Privacy Policy from time to time, and at pffy-cloud’s sole discretion.
</p>

<p>
pffy-cloud encourages visitors to frequently check this page for any changes to its Privacy Policy.
</p>

<p>
Your continued use of this site after any change in this Privacy Policy will constitute your acceptance of such change.
